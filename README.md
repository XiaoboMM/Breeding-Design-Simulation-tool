# Designed-Breeding-Simulation-too
**Designed Breeding Simulation (DBS) tool** is developed for the selection of potential parents and breeding strategies, estimation of breeding population size, and achieving the pyramiding of superior alleles.


## Installation

**DBS tools**  can be installed with the following R code:
```
source("https://github.com/XiaoboMM/Designed-Breeding-Simulation-tool.git")
```
## Example

There are three example datasets attached in DBS tool, , users can export and view the details by following R code:
```
#The genotype of the material at the target QTL. The character format of genotype data to numeric codes of 0, 1 and 2 representing missing, superior alleles and inferior alleles, respectively.
selected_pop<- read.csv((https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XiaoboMM/Designed-Breeding-Simulation-tool/master/data/genotype_pop.csv)", header = T)

```

DBS tool: Designed Breeding Simulation tool
############
DBS tool is developed for the selection of potential parents and breeding strategies, estimation of breeding population size, and achieving the pyramiding of superior alleles. This study provides insights into the genetic correlation among complex traits and develops designed breeding simulation tool.
DBS tool can help breeders to develop effective strategies for variety development.
